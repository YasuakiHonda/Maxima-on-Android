                    What is Maxima on Android?
                </h3>
<p>
Maxima, a computer algebra system written in Common Lisp, now runs on your 
Android mobile devices. Maxima, and its predecessor Macsyma is one of the 
most long-established software in the world. Original development efforts 
were back in 1960s at MIT LCS and Project Mac, and now the development continues 
as an open source project at maxima.sourceforge.net .
</p>
<p>
You can perform many many math operations such as integral, differentiation, 
matrix operations, rational numbers, symbolic treatment of constants such as pi, 
e, euler's gamma, symbolic and numerical treatment of special functions such as 
sin(x), cos(x), log(x), exp(x), zeta(s).
</p>
<p>
Maxima on Android is a port of Maxima on the Android operating system. Thanks 
to Sylvain Ageneau' effort on porting Embeddable Common Lisp (ECL) to the Android OS, 
the latest Maxima code runs nicely on ECL on Android with very small changes to 
the source code.
</p>
<p>
Maxima on Android is a combination of many open source software: ECL on Android, MathJax, Gnuplot, Jquery Mobile, and Maxima itself. I wrote roughly 1600 lines of Java code and 150 lines of HTML including Javascript code. The result images can be viewed below:
</p>
<img src="screen-shot1.png" height=250>
<img src="plot3d.png" height=250>
<p>
The installation of the software requires total of 90MB on the storage. 30MB needs to be installed on the internal storage. The rest 60MB can be installed either on the external or the internal storage. The first run of the apk will ask you where you want the 60MB to be installed.
</p>
<p>
Then you can enjoy Maxima / Macsyma on your mobile phone or tablet.

<p>
 When Maxima on Android is first invoked, it installs additional data
 of 85MB, extracting from the APK. For those whose mobile devices'
 internal memory may be small, I give a choice for you where this 85MB
 to be installed.
</p>

<p>
<img src="MOAInstaller.png" height=250>
When first run, the program will display the messages seen in the left
picture (without showing the progress dialog box). You may choose the
internal or external storage. If the available capacity is less than
necessary, the one (or both) choice will be grayed out. After
selecting one radio button, you can click "Install" button or "Cancel"
button.
</p>
<p>
If you press "Install" button, the installation starts and the
progress dialog box appears on the screen until installation finishes.
</p>
<p>
If you press "Cancel" button, this additional install process is
terminated and nothing will be installed in addition. Then entire
program will quit itself. Later run of this program will start again
from this install window in such a case as necessary binary and data
are not yet installed.<br clear="left">
</p>

<p>
When everything is successfully installed, you will see the following
screen. The screen contains the Maxima on Android information, then
typical Maxima information comes after that.
<img src="startup.png" height=300>
</p>
<p>
The white large space below (%i1) is the place for displaying the
command you typed for execution by Maxima, and also the place for
displaying corresponding result.<br clear="left">

<H4>Enlarge / shrink by fingers</H4>

<p>
You can enlarge/shrink the displayed text (including math formula) by
using two fingers in a standard ways. This scaling works on Maxima main view, manual view, and 
graph drawing view.</p>
<p>Scaling in Maxima main view and manual view are now stored in the
user preference so that it is kept preserved.

<H4>Maxima command input area</H4>
<p>
<img src="startup.png" height=300>
In the left picture, the bottom rectangle area surrounded by the
orange lines is called the Maxima command input area. The area may not
be orange line surrounded in the beginning, but if you touch the area,
the orange lines appear, indicating that the input focus is given to
this text edit area.
</p>
<p>
This is a standard text input field and many edit aids (such as
software keyboard, cut and paste) are available.
</p>
<p>
Here you can enter any Maxima commands. Then Maxima performs the
computation according to the command. The result will be rendered
beautifully using MathJax 2.0, then displayed along with the command
in the white space above the orange surrounded box.
</p>
<p>
The font size used in the Maxima command input area can be changed. You can enter:<br>
<strong>textSize:40</strong><br>
in the Maxima command input area. Pressing enter key, the size of the font will become 40 pixels.
You can specify any number instead of 40, though 10 to 50 is the range for recommendation. 
In the future release, some GUI will replace the textSize command.

In the Maxima manual, so many examples are presented as session
examples. In the left screen shot, applying bern() function to elements of a list is shown.
This is one of such session examples. On touching it, you can execute commands in the
session example in the Maxima main view.
</p>
<p>
Touching a session example (that appear in gray
rectangle, with each input / output with prompts), the viewing of
manual is finished and getting back to Maxima. Then, the first input
line of the session example is copied to the Maxima command input
area.
</p>
<p>
You can type "enter" key to execute the command, or you can edit it as
usual before execution.
</p><br clear="left">
<p>
<img src=nextexample.png height=300>
For further example execution, you can use "Next example" menu. This
will paste the next input line of the session example. Repeating to
choose "Next example" from menu will paste next ones into the Maxima
command input area.

<p>
You need to know syntax and semantics of the Maxima commands. They are
not very difficult, but there are a number of such
commands. </p>
<p>
The followings are simple command examples. You may note that all
lines are ended with a semi-colon.
</p>
<p>
You can just copy each of the followings and paste it
into the command input area for execution.

<div data-role="collapsible"> <!-- Dropbox support -->
<H4>Dropbox support</H4>

<p>
Dropbox is one of the best known cloud storage services in the world. Maxima on Android 
now supports Dropbox to provide the following functionality:
<u>
<li>To share Maxima code on PC with Android devices</li>
<li>To write / edit Maxima code on Android devices</li>
<li>To support loading the Maxima code in Dropbox into Maxima on Android</li>
</u>
</p>
<p>
Let us assume that
<u>
<li>you have an account of Dropbox,</li> 
<li>you installed Dropbox application on your Android device and your PC, and</li>
<li>sharing files through Dropbox between your Android device and PC already works</li>
</u> 
</p>
<p>
Here is step by step instructions on how to load shared files in Maxima on Android:
<u>
<li>You create a test.txt which contains couple of lines of Maxima codes,</li>
<li>You put the file into Dropbox folder on your PC to share it,</li>
<li>You make sure the file is there on your Dropbox application on your Android device, </li>
<li>You may edit test.txt file with Dropbox text editor at any time,</li>
<li>You export test.txt to the SD card by choosing Export and choosing SD card as the destination,</li>
<li>The destination folder MUST be /sdcard/Download folder. Typically this is chosen by default,</li>
<li>Run or return to Maxima on Android</li>
<li>load(test); or load("test.txt");</li>
<li>batch(test); should also work</li>
</u>
Repeating editing and exporting is the typical development cycle. Editing can be
carried out either on Android or PC.  
</p> 
<p>
There are two important things to note. One is that only the text file whose file name ends with 
.txt can be editted on the Dropbox text editor. So, test.txt can be editted, but test.mac cannot be
editted on Android.
</p>
<p>
The other thing to note is that the folder to export must be /sdcard/Download. This folder is already added
to the list of locations where Maxima searches files to load.
</p>
</div> <!-- Dropbox support -->

<div data-role="collapsible"> <!-- Maxima Manual -->

<H4>Maxima Manual</H4>

<p>
Maxima manual is available in the menu. You can choose the language of
the manual from the settings menu. Several languages including English and Japanese 
are available.
</p>
</div> <!-- Maxima Manual -->

<div data-role="collapsible"> <!-- Gnuplot for graph drawing -->
<H4>Gnuplot for graph drawing</H4>

<p>
Now the graph drawing is supported with gnuplot 4.6. You can use the graph
drawing commands available in Maxima, including plot2d, plot3d, draw, draw2d, draw3d
and more.
</p>
<p>
Here are some examples of graph drawing commands:
</p>
<pre>
plot2d(x^3-6*x,[x,-3,3]);
plot3d(x^2-y^2,[x,-5,5],[y,-5,5]);
draw2d(implicit(y^2=x^3-x,x,-2,2,y,-2,2));
</pre>
<p>
Also, after you are back from graph window to the Maxima session
screen, you can redraw the graph again by choosing Graph in the menu.
</p>
</div> <!-- Gnuplot for graph drawing -->



<div data-role="collapsible"> <!-- Qepcad -->
<H4>Qepmax package: Qepcad - Maxima interface</H4>
<p>
<a href="qepmax.html">New manual is here.</a>
</p>
<p>
Qepcad is supported in Maxima on Android via qepmax package. This means that the separte 
Qepcad program is included in this package, and you can use the Qepcad program using 
Maxima commands defined in the qepmax package.

You need to load the qepmax package by doing:
<pre>
(%i1) load(qepmax);
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Qepcad is a program developed by Chris Brown of US Navy Accademy. This program performs
a mathematical algorigthm called 'Quatifier Elimination' for the first order predicate
logic with polynomials over real domain.
</p>
<p>
Here is some example that you can do with Qepcad with the qepmax package:
</p>
<pre>
(%i1) load(qepmax)$
(%i2) qe([[A,x]],x^2-3*x+a>=0);
4 a - 9 >= 0
</pre>
<p>
The above example can be interpreted as follows: What is the condition of 'a' when for all x,
x^2-3*x+a>=0? And the answer is 4*a-9>=0. Manually one can find this condition by 'square complete'
the formula x^2-3*x+a to obtain (x-3*x/2)^2+a-9/4>=0.
</p>
<pre>
(%i4) qe([[E,x],[E,y]],x^2+2*y^2=1 %and m=x+y);
2 m^2 -3 <= 0
</pre>
<p>
The second example above can be interpreted as follows: What is the range of x+y when x and y
satisfies that x^2+2*y^2=1? The answer is -sqrt(3/2) <= m <= sqrt(3/2). Can you find this 
condition by yourself?
</p>
<p>
Function qe() takes two args. One is the list of quantified variables, and the second is a logical
formula with predicates (>, <, =, <=, >=, #) and polinomials over real domain. Together, the args
of qe() represents a formula of the 1st order predicate logic. The formula may contain free
variables. 
</p>
<p>
The result of qe() is a formula representing the equal condition as the 1st order predicate
logic formula specified in args of qe(), but only including such free varialbes. Here, all 
the quntified variables are eliminated.
</p>
<p>
Syntax of the arguments of function qe():<br>
1st argument is a list of quantified variables, You can use A and E as quantifiers (for all and
there exist). [[E,x],[A,x]] is a good example of the list of the quantified variables.<br>
2nd argument is a logical formula with variables appeared in the 1st argument and the free
variables. You can use %and, %or, %not, %implies as the logical operators. You can use <, >, <=,
>=, # as predicates. You can use polynomials and rational functions as terms. So, the valid
formula examples are:<br>
<tt>x^2+2*y^2=1 and m=x+y.</tt><br>
</p>
<p>
Note that the number of variables and degree gets large numbers, the speed gets slower
(double exponential).

<div data-role="collapsible"> <!-- Working with your software keyboard -->
<H4>Working with your software/hardware keyboard</H4>

<p>
IMHO, the best software keyboard suitable for math input is the "Std Math Keyboard" 
availabe in Google Play. (You can search it by its name). 
</p>
<p>
If you are using Kanji input keyboard and / or some
special software keyboard for your language, that is usually NOT the
best one for use with Maxima on Android.
</p>
<p>
How to change software keyboard from one to the other depends on
the Android OS version. Following is applicable to older OS such as
Android 2.2, 2.3.
'Long pressing' the Maxima command input area will pop up a list of actions
you can do. Among them is for selecting the software keyboard for
use. Try changing the software keyboard to Android keyboard.
</p>
<p>
On using hardware keyboard (probably connected through Bluetooth), 
you may find it useful to use tab key to select entire previous 
input text. Typing something new will erase previous input
text automatically.

<p>
Due to a bug in WebView of Android OS 3.x and 4.0.x, Maxima manual in
MOA causes link error when navigating. From MOA 1.8, I have added a
workaround for these OS versions.  You need to separately install
Maxima manual using ADB (Android Debug Bridge, a tool provided in
Android SDK).
</p>
<p>
You need to download a manual package from here. Then you extract the
zip archive. You have a folder "maxima-doc" as the result. Then, in
the terminal program of your OS, % adb push maxima-doc
/data/local/tmp/maxima-doc This will push the document files into
/data/local/tmp/maxima-doc folder in your Android device.
</p>
<p>
From MOA 1.8, if /data/local/tmp/maxima-doc folder exists, files in
the folder will be used for manual viewing, and this will NOT cause
any link error.

Maxima is a symbolic computation program.  It is full featured,
doing symbolic manipulation of polynomials, matrices, rational
functions, integration, Todd-coxeter, graphing, bigfloats.  It has a
symbolic debugger source level debugger for maxima code.  Maxima is
based on the original Macsyma developed at MIT in the 1970's.  It is
quite reliable, and has good garbage collection, and no memory leaks.
It comes with hundreds of self tests.</p>

notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
<br/>
<br/>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such

otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result
of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including

Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
liability.</p>
